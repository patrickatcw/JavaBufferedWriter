//changes made to program
/*
- modify program so that it uses a bufferedreader to read in the
locations data
- modify the main method of the locations class so that it uses
a buffreredwriter to write the data
open the locations.txt and directions.txt files to check that the
data has been written successfully
- make change to the program to allow for the 0 (quit) exits
before using the newly created files
- change the 3 instances of hashmap to linkedhashmap in the
location class ans one instance in the locations class so that you can compare the files
more easily
